## TODO

-   Refactor `sync-apps` script
    -   Probably, after the creation of new-packages.yml, I need to append the task into local.yml file

-   Optimize tasks

-   Set up the correct `node` and `java` versions on the installation part
    -   Is there a way to use `nvm` and `sdk` after they are installed?

-   Find a way to run the tasks in parallel
